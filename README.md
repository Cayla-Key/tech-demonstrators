Tech Demonstrators: Learning open hardware for research prototypes

As a part of my PhD in more-than-human computer interaction I took part in an Open Hardware Training with Davide Gombe. This training focused on open source platforms, languages, sensors, and boards. These lessons were the bases of my early ideations into what would become the final research artifacts called the Leaky Cups. 

Together with the Openness Training provided by Mozilla, these series of ideas and final artifacts use open hardware, software, and licensing to support and inspire their design. This repo to share the tutorials, links and code I used in these explorations.

The project is part of an OpenDoTT PhD (more information at https://opendott.org) at Northumbria University, School of Design and with Mozilla Foundation as a Mozilla Fellow (https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/what-we-fund/fellowships-and-awards-directory/). This project receives funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Skłodowska-Curie grant agreement No 813508.

Supervisors: Cally Gatehouse, Nick Taylor, Kasia Odrozek, and Davide Gomba
